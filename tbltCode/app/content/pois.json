One of Owens Corning’s core values is to reduce its environmental footprint. As part of this sustainability drive, the company set aggressive goals to cut energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><br><p>To help meet these energy goals, Owens Corning collaborated with Constellation to develop a solar generation project. Constellation constructed and owns the 2.4 MW solar array on parking canopies.</p><br><p>Comprised of approximately 8,000 Yingli 305-watt solar photovoltaic modules installed on 935 parking spots, with 16 canopies, the system is expected to generate 3 million kilowatt-hours of energy in the first year – or approximately 30% of the electricity needed annually at the OC headquarters. The solar arrays are expected to have the effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2,069 metric tons of carbon dioxide yearly, equivalent to the emissions of 436 passenger vehicles annually. Owens Corning will purchase the power generated from the solar arrays under a 20 year power purchase agreement. They will also retain the Class I SRECs, enabling them to count the solar generation credits towards their sustainability goals.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p>",

To help enable their consumers to make more sustainable choices, P&amp;G set a goal to obtain 30% of their total (electrical and thermal) energy from renewable sources by 2020. P&amp;G recognized that their paper manufacturing facility in Albany, GA, where they produce Bounty paper towels and Charmin toilet paper, provided an opportunity to make a step change in their renewable energy usage. </p><br><p>The Albany facility had been successfully operating an existing biomass boiler for more than 30 years, taking advantage of the abundant locally available renewable biomass fuel sources. P&amp;G’s interest in expanding and growing its use of biomass coincided with Georgia Power’s response to new state mandates for utilities to purchase power from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and biomass.</p><br><p> Constellation provided the capital to construct the $200 million 50-megawatt CHP plant that is co-located at one of P&amp;G’s largest U.S. facilities, and will lead plant ownership, operation and management. The facility is one of Constellation’s newest projects in its growing distributed energy business, which has more than 300 megawatts of assets in operation or under development. P&amp;G will purchase the steam produced by the plant, which is targeted to provide 100 percent of the steam needs at the Albany facility, representing roughly 60 to 70 percent of the site’s total energy needs. The plant’s fuel supply will come from the locally available and sustainable biomass that would otherwise have been left to decay, be burned, or sent to landfill. </p><br><p>The Albany biomass plant – scheduled to begin commercial operation in June 2017 – will help P&amp;G move closer to its 2020 goal of obtaining 30 percent of its total energy from renewable sources, allowing the company to decrease the plant’s environmental footprint while maintaining unimpeded production of two of its leading brands, Bounty and Charmin.</p>",

The nation’s largest of its kind, the program enables building owners to host solar projects on their rooftops and sell the power generated to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) for distribution on the city’s power grid. </p><br><p>This project required no upfront capital from the City. Constellation owns and operates the solar power system and LADWP will purchase the electricity generated by the solar panels through a 20-year power purchase agreement. The system is located within the Port on the roofs of two classically restored 1940s-era warehouses, one of which is home to CRAFTED, a large-scale permanent marketplace that supports more than 100 local artists. </p><br><p>The solar power system is composed of approximately 3,780 photovoltaic panels and is expected to generate approximately 2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Generating the same amount of electricity using nonrenewable sources would result in the release of approximately 1,880 tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent emissions from 400 passenger vehicles annually, according to LADWP’s estimates. </p><br><p>Constellation owns and operates nearly 70 megawatts of solar installation in the state and recently joined Mayor Garcetti to mark the start of construction of a separate 25-megawatt biogas-fueled cogeneration plant that will supply steam and electricity to power LA Sanitation’s Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant.</p>",
